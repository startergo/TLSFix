# Security.framework is given a weak load command naming the library, so every process that
# loads Security loads it too, at launch, before it can complete a handshake. Security is what
# exports SSLHandshake and the rest, so those are exactly the processes that could use Secure
# Transport. Nothing is injected and no daemon runs.
#
# The flip side is that a library which crashes in its constructor takes down everything that
# loads Security, loginwindow included. If that happens, boot from another volume or into
# single-user mode (Cmd-S, then `mount -uw /`) and put the original back:
#
#   ln -f /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security.original \
#         /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security
