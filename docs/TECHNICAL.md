# AquaTransport for Mac OS X 10.6 – 10.9

Modern TLS for Snow Leopard through Mavericks, by replacing the crypto behind Secure
Transport rather than proxying traffic. Ported from the iOS tweak; the engine
(`src/aquatransport_engine.c`) is shared, the hook layer and URL rewriter are new.

Two independent subsystems in one package:

| Subsystem | What it does | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| TLS engine | Routes Secure Transport through OpenSSL: TLS 1.0–1.3, modern ciphers, OS-delegated trust | every process that loads Security |
| URL rewriter | Applies `redirects.txt` and `headers.txt` at the request layer | apps only (see gating) |

Verified on 10.9.5 (51/51 local tests) and 10.6.8 (`NSURLSession` is 10.9+ and is
skipped there), both `x86_64` and `i386`.

## Build

```
./build-macos.sh          # OpenSSL + dylib, and the package root's root-only tools
./tools/selftest.sh       # per-process tests, installs nothing
```

Everything is vendored: `deps/openssl-3.5.7.tar.gz` (checksum matches upstream). No network
needed to build.

The build enforces three invariants, each guarding a failure that is silent at link time:

1. **Both slices present.** The library needs an `i386` and an `x86_64` slice to load in
   processes of either architecture; the build refuses without both. A weak load command naming
   a library with no slice for the process is skipped in silence, so a build missing one would
   leave that architecture unpatched and say nothing.
2. **Zero exported symbols.** Loaded into another process by any mechanism, the library must
   export nothing: a naive link exports 9252 symbols, the whole `SSL_*`/`EVP_*` namespace
   among them, which would interpose those names in the host.
3. **No post-10.6 libc imports.** `getentropy` is 10.12+; `strndup`, `strnlen`, `getline`,
   `getdelim` are 10.7+. They bind *lazily*, so the dylib loads fine and then kills the
   process on first use. OpenSSL is configured `--with-rand-seed=devrandom` to keep seeding
   off `getentropy`; the check below is what catches any other such import.

## Install

```
sudo ./install-macos.sh install    # place the files, then patch Security.framework
sudo ./install-macos.sh uninstall  # restore Security.framework, then remove the files
```

| path | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/share/aquatransport/` | `aquatransport.dylib` (loader), `aquatransport_engine.dylib`, `flags.txt`, `headers.txt`, `redirects.txt`, `disabled.txt`, and the root-only `insert_dylib`, `aquatransport.sh`, `uninstall.sh` |

The directory is `/usr/share` because of who reads what. A patched process makes both of its reads itself — dyld
maps the dylib at launch, and the library reads the rule files at runtime — so both happen under
*that process's* sandbox, and `/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/system.sb`, imported by every
sandboxed process, grants `file-read*` only for world-readable files under `/System`,
`/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`, `/private/var/db/dyld` and `/Library/Filesystems/NetFSPlugins`:

```scheme
(allow file-read*
       (require-all (file-mode #o0004)
                    (require-any ... (subpath "/usr/share") ...)))
```

A `deny default` daemon — WebKit's `webpushd` is one — reads nothing outside that set. The load
command is weak, so a read the sandbox denies is not an error: the process starts normally and
runs unpatched, with a kernel log line as the only trace.

```
Sandbox: webpushd(715) deny file-read-data /usr/share/aquatransport/aquatransport.dylib
```

That silence is what makes the location load-bearing rather than a matter of taste: a path
outside the grant leaves every sandboxed application unfixed and says nothing. `insert_dylib`
and the installer scripts sit in the same directory, though nothing sandboxed reads them: only
root runs them, to add and remove the load command.

The `(file-mode #o0004)` clause is why the installer sets the dylib and rule files 0644 and the
directory 0755: a stricter mode is readable to root alone, and every sandboxed process goes
unpatched. The tools are 0755 rather than 0644, because root runs them as programs, but 0755 is
world-readable too, so it meets the same clause. Not every sandboxed process is this restricted — `application.sb`, which backs the
app sandbox, carries a blanket `(allow file-read* (subpath "/Library"))` — but `/usr/share` is
what the whole range of them share.

### The load command

`Security.framework` names the dylib in an `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`, so every process that loads
Security loads the library too, as a dependency, before it runs a line of its own code. Nothing
is injected, no daemon runs, and there is no window between a process starting and being
covered.

Security is not one choice among several. `SSLHandshake`, `SSLRead` and the rest of Secure
Transport *are* Security.framework exports, so the set of processes that load Security is
exactly the set that could call them. CFNetwork sits above Security and would miss direct
Secure Transport clients; anything below it — CoreFoundation, libSystem — is loaded by
processes that will never open a socket. Measured on 10.9.5, 46 of 60 sampled running processes
load Security, so this is not much narrower than "everything" in practice; what it buys is
exactness and timing, not a smaller number.

Three details make the difference between a load command that works and one that appears to:

- **The compatibility version must be 0.** dyld refuses a dependency whose compatibility
  version is lower than the one the load command demands, and a *weak* dependency it refuses is
  mapped but never initialised — the library shows up in `DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES` and does
  nothing at all. `insert_dylib` writes 0, which is why the installer uses it rather than
  editing the header itself.
- **Weak, not strong.** A missing dylib is then skipped and every process still starts. That
  covers deletion and a sandbox denial; it does not cover a library that crashes in its
  constructor, which takes down everything that loads Security.
- **The dependency is circular** — the library links Security, and Security now names the
  library — and dyld handles it. Loading does not recurse, because an image is registered
  before its own dependencies are walked; binding happens for the whole launch batch before any
  initialiser runs, and needs Security mapped rather than initialised. Initialisation is where a
  cycle could bite, since dyld returns on re-entering an in-progress image, and here it cannot:
  Security has no initialiser at all on 10.9.5 (no `__mod_init_func`, no `LC_ROUTINES`, in
  either slice), and the library's constructor calls nothing in Security. It rebinds by name,
  and resolves the original entry points lazily on the first hooked call — see *How the hooks
  are installed*.

### Loading from disk instead of the shared cache

Security.framework lives in the dyld shared cache, and dyld uses the cached copy only while the
file on disk still matches the inode and mtime the cache recorded. Patching the file breaks
that match, so every process loads Security from disk instead. Demonstrated by touching the
mtime alone, with no edit: the image moves from `0x7fff94de9000`, inside the shared region, to
`0x10bb92000`.

That is the standing cost of this approach. Measured on 10.9.5 over 40 launches of a program
linking Security and CoreFoundation and nothing else: **+0.8 ms per launch**. Treat that as a
floor rather than the figure for a real application — an image outside the cache loses the
prebound cross-image pointers dyld ships in it, and that loss grows with the number of loaded
images importing Security, which was two here.

It is also why the installer preserves the original as a **hard link** beside it rather than a
copy. A hard link keeps the original inode and mtime, so re-linking it at the framework's path
puts Security back on the shared cache exactly as it was.

Both halves of that matter, and the inode is the one worth demonstrating, since a restore that
gets the content right is easy to assume is complete. A byte-identical copy carrying the
original's exact mtime, differing only in inode, loads from disk at `0x103acb000`; re-linking
the original inode puts it back at `0x7fff94de9000`. So restoring a *copy* leaves every process
loading Security from disk forever after an uninstall. Verified: after `uninstall`, inode, mtime
and bytes all match the original.

### Every slice, including ppc

10.6's Security carries a `ppc` slice for Rosetta alongside `x86_64` and `i386`, and all three
are patched. The `ppc` one gains a load command naming a library with no `ppc` slice, which dyld
weakly skips: a few dozen bytes, no runtime effect, and less machinery than separating it out.

`insert_dylib` takes the whole fat file in one pass, byte-swapping every field it writes against
each slice's own magic, keeping each slice's alignment, and shifting later slices when one
grows. A slice it cannot patch is counted and stepped over; only a file where *every* slice
failed is an error. Growth is why it is handed the container rather than one slice at a time:
10.6's Security has no header padding to spare, so the command cannot be placed without moving
what follows it.

The finished file is renamed over the original, so no launch ever sees a half-written framework.

`insert_dylib` is the only tool the installer needs. That matters more than it sounds: a stock
10.6 has no `otool` and no `nm`, since they are Xcode tools and these are not development
machines. Worth knowing before adding a check that reads a Mach-O — a tool that is absent
returns nothing, nothing is indistinguishable from a real answer, and a missing `otool`
reporting "no load command" blames the binary for the toolchain.


### Recovery

If a patched Security ever stops the machine from booting, the original is a hard link beside
it. From another volume or single-user mode:

```
ln -f /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security.aquatransport-original \
      /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Versions/A/Security
```

### The signature has to be removed, not left invalid

Patching invalidates Security's code signature, and the installer passes `--strip-codesig` so
that nothing is left to validate. A stale signature is the more dangerous of the two: the kernel
validates the pages of a signed library as a signed process maps them, and kills the process
when they do not match. Every signed application then dies before `main()`, while unsigned
command-line binaries carry on unaffected — the whole failure presents as "applications will not
open", with TLS probes still passing.

Reproduced on 10.9.5 against a patched copy through `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, with the system
framework untouched: TextEdit is `Killed: 9` with the signature left in place and launches
normally with it stripped. A test that exercises only unsigned binaries misses this entirely.


### What a patch does not reach

Processes already running keep the Security they mapped at launch, and a library already mapped
survives both the file and the load command that named it. Newly launched processes are covered
immediately; a reboot covers everything.

### Staying out of a process

The installed library is two images. `aquatransport.dylib` is a ~25 KB loader that links
nothing but libc, and it is the only thing Security.framework's load command names.
`aquatransport_engine.dylib` is everything else — the hooks and OpenSSL — and the loader
`dlopen()`s it, from beside itself, only for processes not named in `disabled.txt`.

The split exists because a load command is unconditional. Whatever Security names is mapped
into every process on the system, and a process hosting third-party code cannot always afford
that: Google's Widevine CDM inspects its own address space and refuses to decrypt when it finds
an unexpected 9 MB image there, hanging the tab rather than reporting an error. That check runs
against the *mapping*, before any engine code does, so no flag the engine reads can prevent it —
which is what a gate inside the engine would have been. The only fix available is not to be
mapped, and the only way to be conditionally not-mapped behind an unconditional load command is
for the thing named by it to be a stub that loads the rest itself.

`disabled.txt` holds one executable name per line, matched exactly against
`getprogname()`; `#` begins a comment. An excluded process gets the system TLS stack and
nothing else on the Mac is affected. The shipped default lists
`com.apple.WebKit.WebContent`, Safari's rendering process, which costs nothing because WebKit
does its network I/O in `com.apple.WebKit.Networking` — a separate process that still gets the
engine.

This is a different mechanism from the `kDeny[]` list in `aquatransport_hooks_mac.c`, which
names the trust daemons whose own traffic would otherwise route through our verify path and
make trust evaluation depend on trust evaluation. That list is structural and not user-editable.

### Flags

`flags.txt` in `/usr/share/aquatransport/` holds one flag name per line, read at runtime by
every loaded copy of the library. Two flags are recognised:

```
disabled-mtls   # hand client-certificate connections back to the system stack
debug           # log handshakes to /tmp/aquatransport-<uid>.log
allow-legacy-tls # allow TLS 1.0/1.1 and their cipher suites
```

`allow-legacy-tls` is read per connection rather than once per process, so it applies to connections
opened after the file changes without restarting the application holding them. It lifts the pair
set in `ossl_init`: the minimum protocol version drops from TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.0, and the cipher
list widens from OpenSSL's default to `ALL` at security level 0. Both are needed together — the
level decides whether a suite may be used once selected, the list decides what is offered, and
either alone leaves the handshake failing.

Anonymous suites are excluded in both modes (`!aNULL:!eNULL`). They carry no certificate, so a
server answering with `AECDH-AES256-SHA` gets an encrypted connection that authenticates nobody
and leaves the trust evaluation no chain to reject. Measured against `null.badssl.com`: it
connects when they are offered and fails when they are not.

Measured on 10.9.5 with default settings, `tls-v1-0.badssl.com:1010` and
`tls-v1-1.badssl.com:1011` fail with `-9806` while `tls-v1-2.badssl.com:1012` and ordinary sites
connect; with `allow-legacy-tls` the 1.0 and 1.1 endpoints connect (`TLSv1`,
`ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA`). RC4 and 3DES stay unreachable either way, because the build is
configured `no-legacy` and those algorithms are absent from the library rather than merely
unlisted.

A sandboxed daemon cannot write to `/tmp`, and those are the processes whose handshakes are
hardest to see any other way. `apsd`'s profile grants `file*` under its own per-process temp
directory and nothing under `/tmp`, so a denied open falls back to the directory `confstr`
names — the same one the sandbox parameter names, so the grant covers the file:

```
Sandbox: apsd(1817) deny file-write-create /private/tmp/aquatransport-0.log
/private/var/folders/zz/…/T/aquatransport-0.log      # where it lands instead
```

Find one with `sudo find /private/var/folders -name 'aquatransport-*.log'`.

`tf_flag()` (`aquatransport_config.c`) reports whether a name is a line in `flags.txt`;
`selftest.sh` exercises the mechanism through `debug`. To stop the engine entirely, uninstall
it — the library stays loaded in processes that already have it, so removing the file is not a
way to turn it off.

`install-macos.sh` updates the dylib with `rename(2)`, never an in-place write, so a load in
progress never sees a partially written file.

## How the hooks are installed

Both subsystems rebind symbol pointers by name with fishhook (`deps/fishhook/`).

Rebinding rewrites call sites rather than function bodies, so the "function too small,
clobbers adjacent memory" failure that makes `SSLClose` unsafe under body-patching schemes
cannot occur. The property that carries the design is this: **rebinding does not require the
library to be present at process launch.** A library that arrives late — as this one does in any
process that reaches Security.framework through a `dlopen` — installs these hooks just as well.

Measured on 10.6.8 and 10.9.5, `i386` and `x86_64`: a `dlopen`ed image successfully rebinds
CFNetwork's calls into Secure Transport *after* those symbols have already been bound and
used. Both frameworks live in the dyld shared cache, and the cache does not prevent it.

Two consequences for anyone editing `src/mac/aquatransport_hooks_mac.c`:

- **Never call a hooked function by name from that file.** fishhook rebinds the symbol in
  every loaded image including our own, so `SSLHandshake(c)` lands back in the replacement
  and recurses until the process dies. Call through the `o_SSLHandshake` pointer. For the
  same reason, `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, ...)` resolves back to the replacement and must not be used.
- **The `o_*` originals come from `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)`, not from fishhook's `replaced`
  output.** fishhook reports whatever value was in the symbol slot, and for a lazy symbol
  that has never been called that value is dyld's stub helper rather than the function.
  `dlsym` resolves through the symbol table and is correct whether or not the symbol has
  ever been bound.

`install_ssl_hooks()` decides per process whether to install anything, so a process on the
trust-daemon deny list carries no hooks at all. The per-hook `tf_on()` gate still runs on
every call: `tf_reentrant()` is dynamic and cannot be decided at install time.

## Rules

Blocks separated by blank lines, each beginning with a **scope** line: `*` for every
process, or a comma-separated list of app bundle names. Commas rather than spaces because
executable names contain them (`QuickTime Player`); space around a comma is trimmed. A
trailing `.app` is optional, and the executable name is matched as well as the bundle name.
URLs are always matched as a **prefix**, so the tail and any query string survive. `*` is
the only wildcard (`?` is literal) and works the same in both files. It matches any run of
characters **except `/`**, which is what makes `https://*.wikipedia.org/` cover
`en.wikipedia.org` and `en.m.wikipedia.org` while never spanning a path separator — an
unrestricted star would let `https://*.apple.com/` match
`https://tracker.example/?u=https://cdn.apple.com/x`. Changes are picked up on mtime
change, no restart. Working examples are in `examples/`.

There is no comment syntax. Every non-blank line is part of a rule, so a `#` line is read
as rule content like any other.

`redirects.txt` — scope, from, to. `from` is a prefix, so the tail and query survive; what
a `*` consumed is dropped rather than carried into the replacement:

```
HelpViewer
https://help.apple.com/Library/Documentation/Resources/Flamingo/6/flamingo.js
https://mavericksforever.com/resources/flamingo.js

Pages, Numbers, Keynote
https://configuration.apple.com/configurations/internetservices/iworkapps/RemoteDefaults.plist
https://mavericksforever.com/resources/RemoteDefaults.plist

*
https://api.twitter.com/
https://twb.preloading.dev/
```

`headers.txt` — scope, URL pattern, then headers to set:

```
Dictionary
https://*.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=
User-Agent: Something Else
```

Scope matches the process that **issues** the request, which is not always the app you have
in mind. WebKit1 apps load in-process, so `Dictionary`, `HelpViewer`, the iWork apps and
`Twitter` all work. A **WebKit2 app hands its loads to the shared
`com.apple.WebKit.Networking` service**, so a rule scoped to `Safari` will never match —
use `*` for those, or scope nothing and accept system-wide application.

A block too short to hold a scope line is ignored.

Rewriting happens at the request layer, not in the TLS stream, because the interesting
rules change the destination host — and by the time `SSLWrite` runs, CFNetwork has already
resolved DNS and handshaked with the *original* host. At the request layer CFNetwork does
DNS, SNI and certificate validation against the rewritten host, and `http://` rules and
`http`→`https` upgrades work too.

### How the rewriter works, and why it is pure C

No process gating. Nothing is special-cased. The rewriter is compiled into the dylib and
works by rebinding two CFNetwork functions at runtime.

It is pure C, not an Objective-C `NSURLProtocol` bundle, because loading Foundation and the
ObjC runtime into a process that then forks without exec is fatal to the child:

- **`sshd`** — confirmed. libdispatch aborts in the privilege-separation child
  (`BUG in libdispatch`, SIGILL on `com.apple.libdispatch-manager`); every ssh connection
  died. Reproduced on an alternate port, fixed by not loading the bundle, broken again by
  loading it.
- **`loginwindow`** — implicated in a login-keychain unlock failure.

No property-based gate works: "a Foundation symbol is resolvable" is true inside `sshd`, and
"the main executable links Foundation directly" excludes Safari and WebProcess (they reach it
through WebKit) while including `loginwindow`. Excluding processes by name only hides the
fragility — the next thing to break is something nobody thought to list.

Foundation's own URL loading sits on CFNetwork's C API (Foundation imports 69 of those
symbols on 10.9, 53 on 10.6.8), so working there covers `NSURLConnection`, `NSURLSession`
and raw CFNetwork clients while touching no Objective-C, no libdispatch and no Foundation.

**Rebinding rather than interposing.** A `__DATA,__interpose` section only takes effect on
images bound after the interposing library is registered, and dyld registers it only for
libraries inserted at launch. Measured on 10.9.5: the same dylib interposing `getppid`
returns 4242 under `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, and changes nothing when `dlopen`ed into a
running process. That rules out static interposing here, because a process that `dlopen`s
Security gets this library at that moment rather than at launch.

Interposing is also address-based — a tuple names a definition, not a name — so a hook
cannot be installed before the target library is loaded and its symbols are addressable.
Rebinding by name needs nothing loaded, which is what lets the library sit inert in a
process that never does TLS. Processes without CFNetwork have nothing to rebind.

`dyld_dynamic_interpose` would sidestep the first point but not the second, and does not
exist before 10.10: on 10.9.5 it is absent from `libdyld.dylib`, from dyld's
`_dyld_func_lookup` table, and from `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)`.

The hook points come from experiment, not from headers, because these are private API:

| Path | Entry point | Request arg |
|---|---|---|
| synchronous | `CFURLConnectionSendSynchronousRequest` | arg 0 |
| asynchronous | `CFURLConnectionCreateWithProperties` | arg 1 |
| every CFURLRequest path | `CFURLRequestCreateMutableCopy` | arg 1 |
| raw stream | `CFHTTPMessageCreateRequest` | arg 2, the URL |
| raw stream | `CFHTTPMessageSetHeaderFieldValue` | arg 0 |

The last two carry the raw-stream path: a client that builds a `CFHTTPMessage` and opens a
stream on it reaches none of the `CFURLRequest` entry points. Such a message also carries only
the headers its author set, so the request can go out with no `User-Agent`, which Wikipedia
answers with an error rather than results.

The message is taken at creation rather than at `CFReadStreamCreateForHTTPRequest`, because
that function is one applications replace for themselves: Dictionary bundles a `ProxyFix.dylib`
that interposes it to route requests through the system proxy. Two hooks on one symbol each
call what they take to be the original, which is the other, and the pair recurses until the
stack is gone. Creation is uncontended.

The setter is hooked because a caller may set headers after the message exists:
DictionaryServices stamps `User-Agent: AppleDictionaryService/208` over whatever is there. A
write to a header a rule owns is dropped, leaving the rule's value in place; every other header
is set as the caller asked. A rule therefore beats the application, which is what lets
`headers.txt` replace a `User-Agent` an application insists on.

The argument positions are the ones found by recording pointers returned from the
request-creating functions and testing the funnel arguments for pointer **equality** — no
guessed pointer is ever dereferenced, so a wrong guess could not crash. Hooks declare six
pointer parameters against real arities of four: passing more arguments than the callee
reads is harmless on both x86_64 and i386, while declaring fewer would make it read
uninitialised registers.

### The one list that remains, and why

`ocspd`, `securityd`, `securityd_service`, `trustd` are excluded from the engine. That is
not "things that happen to break" — it is a circular dependency: our verify path calls
`SecTrustEvaluate`, which those processes *implement*. A re-entrancy guard
(`tf_guard_enter`/`tf_reentrant`, pthread-specific rather than `__thread` for 10.6)
handles the same-thread case; these four are where the cycle crosses a process boundary.

Anything else misbehaving with the library loaded is a bug in the engine to fix, not a name to
add.

## Client certificates the security level would refuse

OpenSSL's security level judges the certificate the client *sends* by the same bar it applies
to the peer's chain. At the default level 2 — 112 bits, no SHA-1 — a 1024-bit client key is
dropped inside `tls_choose_sigalg`, and a client with nothing left to send sends an **empty
Certificate message** rather than failing.

Apple still issues 1024-bit device identities. `apsd`'s push certificate is one, so this is
what the failure looked like on a machine with the library installed:

```
client_cert_cb host=courier.push.apple.com haveX509=1 keybits=1024 seclevel=2
handshake ok  host=courier.push.apple.com proto=TLSv1.3 cipher=TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
SSLRead ABORT ssl_err=1 reason=399  str=ee key too small
SSLRead ABORT ssl_err=1 reason=1116 str=tlsv13 alert certificate required
```

— every 300 ms, forever: `apsd` never held a courier connection, so nothing that rides Apple
push worked, iMessage included. Messages sent from the app sat with `error=4` in `chat.db`.

Two things make it hard to see. The handshake **succeeds**: under TLS 1.3 the client finishes
before the server has answered, so the rejection arrives later as an alert on the first read.
And the client's own logs say nothing about the certificate, because from its side nothing
went wrong — only the server knows an empty Certificate arrived, which is why the regression
test asks a server (`tools/mtlssrv.c`) instead of the client.

Refusing our own weak key protects nobody: the key is the service's choice, the stock stack
uses it without complaint, and the alternative is not a stronger connection but no connection.
So `sec_cb` exempts certificates this library supplied — identified by pointer, since
`client_cert_cb` hands OpenSSL those exact objects — and requires the check to be one OpenSSL
did not mark `SSL_SECOP_PEER`, so no relaxation can reach the peer's chain even if a pointer
somehow matched. Every other check goes to the default callback, saved before ours is
installed, so the rest of the level applies unchanged.

`selftest.sh` covers both key sizes against a local server that reports what it received.
Measured against a build without the exemption: RSA-1024 `NO_CLIENT_CERT`, RSA-2048
`CLIENT_CERT` — so the test discriminates rather than merely passing.

### Clearing the error queue is part of the read contract

`SSL_get_error()` reports `SSL_ERROR_SSL` whenever the thread's error queue is non-empty,
whatever the call it is asked about actually did. One error left behind by an earlier
operation — on this connection, on another connection, on any OpenSSL call the thread made —
therefore turns the next would-block into a protocol failure.

That is not a cosmetic misreport here. `errSSLWouldBlock` means "come back" and
`errSSLClosedAbort` means the stream is dead, and CFNetwork acts on the difference. In the
trace above, the first `SSLRead` had merely found the socket empty; it reported an abort
because `SSL_R_EE_KEY_TOO_SMALL` from the certificate selection was still queued from the
handshake. So `ERR_clear_error()` runs before every `SSL_read`, `SSL_write` and
`SSL_do_handshake` in this library, `sh_flush_write` included.

## The I/O contract

`SSLRead` and `SSLWrite` are replaced, so what they *answer* is part of the interface, not an
implementation detail. CFNetwork's socket streams are written against Secure Transport's
answers exactly, and a plausible-looking substitute is not good enough: a status that differs
from what the stock stack returns in the same state fails the whole stream rather than
degrading.

The failure has a shape worth recognising, because it hides from ordinary use. A request whose
body fits in the socket send buffer never blocks, so it never reaches the interesting states at
all — every GET, and every small POST, behaves identically under any of these answers. Only a
body large enough to fill the send buffer gets there, which puts the boundary between a 10 KB
upload and a 200 KB one, and makes "browsing works" say nothing about whether the contract is
right.

So the contract is measured rather than reasoned about. `tools/writecontract.c` and
`tools/readcontract.c` drive Secure Transport with I/O callbacks of their own that they can
starve on demand, putting the transport in each state that matters and recording what comes
back. Run against the stock stack they produce the reference answers below; run against the
engine they must produce the same ones. `selftest.sh` runs both ways and diffs, so the
assertion is "matches Secure Transport" rather than numbers someone once wrote down.

### Writing

| state | status | `*processed` |
|---|---|---|
| data offered, transport blocks | `errSSLWouldBlock` | **= `dataLength`** |
| zero length, still blocked | `errSSLWouldBlock` | 0 |
| zero length, transport free | `noErr` | 0, queue drained |
| data offered, queue still full | `errSSLWouldBlock` | **0**, data refused |

The first row carries the rest. A blocked write takes the caller's **whole buffer** into the
context's own queue and says so, which makes `errSSLWouldBlock` mean *"I am holding it, come
back"* rather than *"I did nothing"*. Reporting no progress on data the caller has not been
relieved of is the one answer it cannot act on.

Three consequences follow, and each is load-bearing:

- **The retry is zero-length.** The caller advances by `*processed`, and `*processed` was the
  whole buffer, so there is nothing left to re-present. Its next call is a pure flush — which
  is why a zero length must never reach `SSL_write`, whose zero-length return reads as an
  error and would abort a connection that is merely being flushed.
- **Refusing new data while the queue is full is the backpressure**, and it is what bounds the
  queue at one call's worth. Nothing more is accepted until it drains, so no amount of upload
  becomes an in-memory copy of the body.
- **The retry needs `SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER`.** The queue is our copy, so a
  resumed `SSL_write` presents the same bytes at a different address; the mode permits exactly
  that, and the length only ever grows, which is the part no mode relaxes.

`bio_bwrite` asks the caller's write callback **at most once per entry**, matching
`sslIoWrite`, which makes exactly one `ioCtx.write` call and returns what it says. OpenSSL's
record layer would otherwise loop against a transport that has already reported would-block.
The latch clears on each entry — a write, a read, or a handshake — since that is the point at
which the caller has decided the socket is worth trying again.

Nothing here waits on the socket. The caller comes back on its own, exactly as it does with the
stock stack, so a large upload costs the connections sharing its run loop nothing.

### Reading

| state | status | `*processed` |
|---|---|---|
| anything transferred | `noErr` | what was transferred, short or not |
| nothing available | `errSSLWouldBlock` | 0 |
| zero length asked | `noErr` | 0, transport not touched |

The status reports **progress, not fullness**. A short read is `noErr`, and the bytes left over
are not lost to the caller: they are held here and `SSLGetBufferedReadSize` reports them. Those
two halves are one mechanism — a short `noErr` is only safe because that hook answers
truthfully, and the hook is only worth answering because short reads are normal. `SSL_pending`
alone would under-report it, since bytes pulled off the socket but not yet decrypted are
invisible to it; `SSL_has_pending` covers both kinds, which is what the question is asking.

One record per call is what comes back, which is both what the stock stack returns and what
`SSL_read` yields. Filling the caller's buffer from further records would be legal, since the
status says progress rather than fullness, but it would answer differently from the stack being
replaced and buy nothing: the bytes it delivered early are reported by `SSLGetBufferedReadSize`
and collected by the next call, which the caller makes either way.

An end of stream or an error reached *after* some bytes is not allowed to swallow them: the
data is handed over with `noErr` and the condition surfaces on the next call, once there is
nothing left to deliver first.

### The one thing that does not match, and why it cannot

Every status and every `*processed` above matches the stock stack. What does not is how many
times the transport is asked, in one case: reading a response, the engine calls the read
callback four times where the stock stack calls it twice.

That is not the read path. It is **TLS 1.3**. The stock stack cannot negotiate it and lands on
1.2, where session tickets arrive inside the handshake; the engine negotiates 1.3, where the
server sends `NewSessionTicket` as post-handshake records that are read on the application
path. Two tickets, arriving inline, are the extra reads — visible in the debug log as two
`session cached` lines during the first read.

Capping the engine at `TLS1_2_VERSION` collapses the count to 2, matching stock exactly, which
is what says the read logic is not responsible. Removing the difference means giving up TLS
1.3, which is the reason this engine exists. So `selftest.sh` compares the statuses and
`*processed` and drops the callback counts — and the byte totals with them, which differ by
record overhead for the same reason.

### Sizes

`dataLength` is a `size_t` on both entry points and Secure Transport documents no limit on it,
fragmenting into records internally. `SSL_read` and `SSL_write` take an `int`. So a caller's
buffer is transferred in runs of `IO_RUN_MAX` rather than handed over whole, and any length
works. CFNetwork never exposes this — it chunks at 32 KB whatever the body size — so only a
direct Secure Transport caller reaches it, which mail clients and other socket-level code are.
`tools/bigbufprobe.c` covers both directions: a megabyte through one `SSLWrite`, and an
`SSLRead` buffer whose length does not fit in an `int`.

## What a trust evaluation costs

`SecTrustEvaluate` is the single most expensive thing on a connection. Where a chain's issuer
CRL is already cached, a profile puts it in `mulg`, `modg_via_recip`, `grammarSquare`,
`gshiftright` — Security.framework's CryptKit "giants" bignum routines, verifying the chain's
signatures in software. That part is local arithmetic, not a bloated trust store (211 roots)
and not IPC (`securityd` and `ocspd` sit at 0% CPU while it runs), and it reproduces in a
clean process with no library loaded. Where the issuer CRL is *not* cached, a synchronous
download dominates instead, and the profile moves to `tpFetchCrlFromNet`.

Two things drive it. One is signature verification, which varies by chain: measured by
`tools/trustbench.c`, an RSA-2048 chain (`www.gnu.org`) evaluates in 20 ms where an ECDSA one
(`github.com`) takes 486 ms. The other is revocation checking, covered in the next section,
which adds a fixed overhead to every evaluation and a large one-off cost per issuer. The
multi-second stalls come from revocation rather than from the signature algorithm, so they
happen on RSA hosts as readily as ECDSA ones.

**Nothing about it is cached, anywhere.** `trustbench` re-evaluates the same `SecTrustRef` a
second time and it costs the same as the first (461 ms vs 464 ms on Wikipedia's chain); a
fresh object over identical certificates costs the same again. There is no warm-up to exploit
and no result to reuse, so the only saving available is not asking twice — which is what
*Trust evaluation, once per connection* and *The verified-chain cache* below do.

Whatever remains is a floor, not something this engine can optimise away. The OpenSSL linked
into this library does the same arithmetic roughly two orders of magnitude faster, but
CFNetwork evaluates the `SecTrustRef` handed back to it, so a real `SecTrustEvaluate` has to
happen somewhere.

## Revocation checking

Trust evaluation on 10.9 checks revocation by "best attempt", through Security's legacy CSSM
path. The engine leaves it there: it builds each `SecTrustRef` with the SSL policy alone and
sets no revocation policy of its own.

That is a deliberate choice, because naming an explicit revocation policy turns the check off.
`tools/crltest/` demonstrates it with a private CA, two leaves — one of them revoked — and a
CRL published at the leaf's distribution point on localhost. Nothing is installed: the CA is
made an anchor with `SecTrustSetAnchorCertificates` for one `SecTrustRef` in one process, so
no keychain and no system trust store is involved.

| certificate | policy | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| good | SSL policy alone | ACCEPTED |
| **revoked** | **SSL policy alone** | **REJECTED**, and the CRL is fetched |
| revoked | explicit `CRL` | ACCEPTED |
| revoked | explicit `OCSP\|CRL` | ACCEPTED |
| revoked | explicit `OCSP` | ACCEPTED |

Reproduces 3/3 each way. CRL checking on this platform works: the legacy path fetches the CRL
and rejects the revoked certificate, while every explicit revocation policy — including one
naming `kSecRevocationCRLMethod` — skips the fetch and accepts it. There is no combination
that keeps the check and avoids the cost.

The cost is real, and it is the largest remaining one on a connection. Staying on the legacy
path is about 1.7x slower per evaluation whether or not any revocation data exists:
`github.com`'s issuer publishes no CRL distribution point at all, so no CRL work is possible
there, and it still costs 540 ms against 320 ms under any explicit policy. On top of that, a
CRL that is not yet cached is fetched synchronously inside `SecTrustEvaluate`, on whichever
thread asked — a DigiCert chain costs **911 ms against 32 ms**, the whole difference being one
download. A machine in ordinary use accumulates **81 MB across 66 issuers in `/var/db/crls`,
one file of 46 MB with 987,186 entries**. A CRL already cached is cheap to consult (Amazon and
GoDaddy chains evaluate in 7–8 ms), so the download is a per-issuer cost rather than a
per-evaluation one.

Where the asking thread is a browser's shared networking process main thread, one uncached CRL
stalls every connection that process has at once. That is a property of the caller, not of the
engine; see *Where the evaluation happens* below.

### What revocation does not cover

Revocation status is undetermined for a growing share of the web, and this is upstream of the
OS rather than a property of the engine. **Let's Encrypt and Google Trust Services no longer
publish OCSP**: their leaves carry a CA Issuers URI and no responder URI. The only
channel left for those certificates is the CRL in their distribution point, and 10.9 does not
fetch it — zero packets to the distribution point, and nothing from those issuers anywhere in
`/var/db/crls`.

`tools/revcheck.c` shows the consequence on `revoked.badssl.com`, a genuinely revoked,
unexpired Let's Encrypt certificate: every policy 10.9 offers accepts it, including
`kSecRevocationRequirePositiveResponse`, whose whole purpose is to turn "could not determine"
into a rejection. Its CRL is current, 37 KB, lists the serial, and downloads in 55 ms; it is
simply never requested.

The two halves line up: every issuer whose CRL 10.9 fetches also publishes OCSP, and every
issuer that has dropped OCSP is one whose CRL it does not fetch. So revocation is checked for
traditional CAs and unchecked for the modern ones, and no configuration available at this
layer changes that.

## Trust evaluation, once per connection

CFNetwork calls `SSLCopyPeerTrust` on *every request*, not once per connection, and a fresh
`SecTrustRef` built from freshly created `SecCertificateRef`s costs a full evaluation each
time — the system's own caching never sees the same object twice. So the `SecTrustRef` has to
be kept off the per-request path. This is the cost that matters most in practice: a browser
loads dozens of small subresources over a handful of pooled connections, so nearly all of its
requests are warm ones.

The peer chain cannot change within a connection, so neither can the trust decision.
`sh_build_trust` builds the `SecTrustRef` once and caches it on the `Shadow` for the life of
the connection, with each caller still getting its own reference (`SSLCopyPeerTrust` has copy
semantics). The cache is dropped whenever the `SSL` object is re-initialised — late SNI, or
`SSLSetCertificate` — because that means a new handshake and a new chain.

### The object is handed back unevaluated

`sh_build_trust` returns the `SecTrustRef` without evaluating it. Exactly one evaluation of a
chain then happens per connection: `verify_chain`'s on the plain path, or CFNetwork's own on
the app-verified path, which is the one CFNetwork takes on nearly every connection.

Evaluating here as well would be pure duplicated cost on the connection's critical path —
hundreds of milliseconds for a chain whose issuer CRL is cached, and most of a second for one
whose is not:

- **The result would not be the security decision.** That belongs to `verify_chain` or to
  CFNetwork's evaluation of the object; a result computed here is read by nothing.
- **It could not be reused for CFNetwork's evaluation either.** CFNetwork calls
  `SecTrustSetKeychains` on the object immediately before evaluating it, which invalidates any
  result already recorded on it.
- **Nothing needs the object pre-settled.** `tools/trustbench.c` calls
  `SecTrustCopyExceptions` and `SecTrustGetCertificateCount` on a trust that has never been
  evaluated: both succeed, because Security evaluates on demand underneath them.

Measured on 10.9.5, x86_64, 12 parallel requests across 12 cold hosts (`tools/concprobe.m`),
against the same engine evaluating in `sh_build_trust` as well, three runs each:

| | first round, all connections cold |
|---|---|
| Two evaluations per connection | 7.50 s / 7.59 s / 7.33 s |
| **One evaluation per connection** | **3.89 s / 3.90 s / 4.18 s** |

and on 10 pooled warm requests over one connection (`tools/poolprobe.m`), where the single
remaining evaluation is CFNetwork's own and the engine is at parity with the stock stack:

| | wall | CPU |
|---|---|---|
| Native Secure Transport | 0.97 / 1.08 / 0.92 s | 0.51 s |
| **AquaTransport** | **1.00 / 1.19 / 0.90 s** | **0.49 s** |

### Where the evaluation happens

The one remaining evaluation runs wherever the caller asks for it, and for a browser that
placement dominates everything else. WebKit forwards each server-trust challenge to the UI
process; encoding the `NSURLProtectionSpace` for that IPC archives the `SecTrustRef`, and
archiving one evaluates it:

```
WKNetworkSessionDelegate URLSession:task:didReceiveChallenge:
  -> NetworkLoad::didReceiveChallenge
    -> AuthenticationManager::didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge
      -> IPC encode of NSURLProtectionSpace
        -> SerializableArchive::add(CFString, __SecTrust*)
          -> SecTrustEvaluate
```

That path runs on the shared networking process's **main thread**, so every connection's
evaluation serialises behind every other one, and an uncached CRL fetch inside one of them
stalls the whole browser. Sampling `com.apple.WebKit.Networking` during a cold page load puts
874 samples there. Nothing in this engine can move it; the placement belongs to the caller.

## The verified-chain cache

One evaluation per connection is what the stock stack costs too. What is avoidable beyond that
is re-verifying a chain this process has *already* verified: a browser opens several
connections to one host at once, and every one of them runs `verify_chain` over an identical
chain.

`aquatransport_engine.c` keeps a 32-entry cache keyed on the peer name and a SHA-256 over the
chain's DER, with a 10-minute TTL. `verify_chain` consults it before calling
`SecTrustEvaluate` and fills it after a success. Measured on `en.wikipedia.org`, six
connections in one process: the first `verify_chain` costs 481 ms and the rest are free.

Two properties keep it from becoming a way round a rejection:

- **Only successes are cached.** A chain that fails evaluation is never recorded, so it is
  re-examined at full price on every connection. Nothing an attacker presents can be answered
  from this cache.
- **The key covers everything the decision depends on** — the peer name the handshake is
  bound to, and every certificate the server sent, in order. A different chain, or the same
  chain for a different host, misses.

The TTL bounds how long a newly-expired or newly-revoked certificate could ride a cached
success, which is the same order of exposure a resumed TLS session already carries.
`selftest.sh` asserts the security property directly: `expired` and `untrusted-root`
`badssl.com` must be rejected on all four of four connections in one process, and a valid host
immediately followed by `wrong.host.badssl.com` must not carry its success across.

**Once per connection is what Secure Transport itself does**, measured rather than assumed.
Native CPU, same host:

| | user CPU |
|---|---|
| 1 connection × 6 requests | 0.595 s |
| 1 connection × 12 requests | 0.644 s |
| 6 connections × 1 request | 2.164 s |

Doubling the *requests* on one connection costs nothing; going from one *connection* to six
costs +1.57 s, about 314 ms each. The stock stack evaluates once per connection, and the engine
matches it: one `SecTrustEvaluate` per connection, CFNetwork's own. The verified-chain cache
above goes one step further within a process, for repeats of a chain already verified there.

Only `poolprobe` can see the per-request half of this. Every other harness here forces a new
connection per request (`multiprobe` sends `Connection: close`, and `CFReadStream` does not
pool at all), which buries a per-request evaluation under handshake and network time.
`selftest.sh` asserts the evaluation count rather than timing it, so a regression shows up as a
count rather than as noise.

## Session resumption

Secure Transport keeps a session cache, so the engine keeps one too. Without it every
connection pays a full handshake where the stock stack resumes — an extra round trip against a
TLS 1.2 server, plus the certificate chain and its signature checks, on every connection. A
browser opens a lot of connections to the same host, so this dominates everything else in the
engine.

`aquatransport_engine.c` keeps a 32-entry LRU cache of `SSL_SESSION`s, filled from
`new_session_cb` and offered by `ossl_init` through `SSL_set_session`. OpenSSL checks the
session's own validity and falls back to a full handshake if it has expired or the server
declines it, so nothing here reasons about lifetime.

The key is the caller's `SSLSetPeerID` blob, recorded by the hook of the same name — which is
what Secure Transport keys its own cache on: "data, opaque to this library, which is sufficient
to uniquely identify the peer of the current session. An example would be IP address and port"
(`SecureTransport.h`). CFNetwork passes `{<address>:<port>}<hostname>`.

A hostname on its own is not a safe key, because it does not separate two servers reached at
the same name on different ports. `https://www.ssllabs.com/` and the 512-bit-DH server at
`https://www.ssllabs.com:10445/` are one such pair: keyed on the name, the first server's
session was offered to the second, which risks resuming onto a configuration that connection
never validated. The peer id separates them, and the debug log shows the second connection as
a `session MISS`.

A connection whose caller set no peer id is neither cached nor resumed. The same header calls
`SSLSetPeerID` "mandatory if this session is to be resumable", so this matches stock, and with
nothing identifying the endpoint there is no key that can be trusted to name it.

Measured on 10.9.5, x86_64, 40 sequential connections to `www.cloudflare.com` each forced onto
a fresh connection (`tools/multiprobe.c`):

| | mean per connection |
|---|---|
| Native Secure Transport | 429 ms |
| **AquaTransport** | **129 ms** |

The first connection to a host costs ~450 ms; every one after it lands at ~82 ms. Bulk
throughput is unaffected (20 MB download: 2007 ms vs 2175 ms native), which is what says the
per-call read/write path is not worth optimising — resumption is where the time is.

Two things the cache deliberately does not do:

- **Connections carrying a client certificate are never cached or resumed.** The key does not
  include the identity, so a resumed session could otherwise carry an identity the caller did
  not choose for this connection. mTLS connections are rare and a full handshake for them
  costs nothing anyone will notice.
- **It does not weaken validation.** Resumption skips the certificate message, so
  `verify_chain` does not run on a resumed connection — correct, and what every TLS client
  does, since a session only enters the cache after a handshake that already verified. The
  app-verified path is unaffected too: the chain lives on in the `SSL_SESSION`, so
  `SSLCopyPeerTrust` hands CFNetwork the same certificates to evaluate on a resumed
  connection as on a fresh one. `selftest.sh` asserts this directly — three connections to
  `wrong.host.badssl.com` and `expired.badssl.com` in one process, with a warm cache, must
  all be rejected.

`flags.txt`, `redirects.txt` and `headers.txt` are still re-read when their mtime changes, but
that check is throttled to once a second. Unthrottled it costs a `stat()` for each rule file on
every HTTP request and a full open/read of `flags.txt` on every connection presenting a client
certificate; a second is far below the granularity at which anyone edits these files.

## Platform notes

**Trust is the OS's job.** OpenSSL does the crypto; `SecTrustEvaluate` or CFNetwork makes
the decision, against the live system trust store. 10.6.8 validates modern chains
correctly once modern roots are installed, so no OpenSSL-side verifier is needed. A stock
10.6 has no modern roots — install them first or everything looks broken.

In practice CFNetwork sets `kSSLSessionOptionBreakOnServerAuth` on nearly every
connection, so the app-verified path (`sh_build_trust` → CFNetwork evaluates) is the
common one, not an edge case for pinning apps.

**mTLS.** `SecKeyRawSign` and `SecKeyDecrypt` exist on both 10.6 and 10.9 (exported but
absent from the OS X headers, so declared in `aquatransport.h`), so the private key never
leaves the keychain. RSA identities only; anything else falls back to the system stack
(`capture_identity`).

Both RSA padding modes are supported, and both are needed. OpenSSL picks the
`CertificateVerify` algorithm from what the server offers without consulting what our
`RSA_METHOD` can do, and `rsa_pss_rsae_*` precedes `rsa_pkcs1_*` in the modern defaults;
TLS 1.3 permits nothing but PSS. A PKCS#1-only signer would fail against most current
servers and every 1.3 one. `SSL_set1_client_sigalgs_list` could force PKCS#1 instead — the
iOS original does exactly that — but it gives up TLS 1.3 client certificates altogether.

So `rsa_seckey_priv_enc` handles `RSA_NO_PADDING` as well, where OpenSSL has already built
the PSS block and wants only `m^d mod n` over it. That raw operation is `SecKeyDecrypt` with
`kSecPaddingNone` — an RSA private decrypt without padding is the same modular exponentiation
as a raw sign — which takes exactly one block.

`SecKeyRawSign` cannot serve here: **its `kSecPaddingNone` is not a raw operation on OS X.**
It still applies PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, so a full-block input comes back
`errSecInputLengthError` (on 10.9.5, inputs up to blocksize−11 are accepted and anything
larger fails). "None" there means no DigestInfo, not no padding.

`tools/pssprobe.c` measures all of this on a live machine: it builds the same public-only
RSA with the same custom method, signs through EVP the way OpenSSL's CertificateVerify does,
and verifies against the plain public key. On 10.9.5 both padding modes verify, and 4000 PSS
signatures produced no failures. The short-block guard in that function (right-align and
zero-fill) is defensive: 10.9 always returns a full block, and it does not fire across those
4000. It is there because a raw result carries a leading zero byte about 1 time in 256, and
OpenSSL uses the returned length verbatim as the signature length, so a CSP that trimmed to
the minimal-length integer would produce an intermittently malformed signature.

One caveat this cannot test with a generated key: keychain ACLs distinguish *sign* from
*decrypt* authorisation. An identity whose ACL grants signing but not decryption would fail
the PSS path, and possibly prompt. Ordinary `.p12` imports grant both.

No version cap on client-certificate connections. `tls_prepare_client_certificate()` is
version agnostic in OpenSSL — it calls `client_cert_cb` for TLS 1.3 as well, and honours the
same `-1` → `SSL_X509_LOOKUP` suspend, so the pre-approval pause survives at every version.
`tools/mtlsprobe.c` drives it end to end against a local `s_server` requiring a client
certificate; verified at TLS 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3, with the server confirming the client
certificate each time. `disabled-mtls` is the escape hatch.

**OpenSSL 3.5.** The current LTS, supported to 2030-04. The engine's floor is TLS 1.0: a
legacy server that stock Secure Transport can reach must stay reachable through the engine,
since anything less is worse than not installing at all. Two settings carry that.

Security level 0 permits the legacy suites but does not offer them, so
`SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(gCtx, "ALL")` is what puts them in the ClientHello — without it a
TLS 1.0 server fails on cipher overlap rather than version. And the i386 slice needs
`-DBROKEN_CLANG_ATOMICS`: this era's clang cannot emit the 8-byte atomic in
`threads_pthread.c` ("cannot compile this atomic library call yet"), and that macro is
OpenSSL's own escape hatch, selecting the mutex-backed paths instead.

To exercise the patch end-to-end without installing it, point one process at a patched copy of
the framework. `AQ_SECURITY_PATH` patches a copy, `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` makes one process use
it, and the system framework is never touched:

## Coverage

Only apps that use Secure Transport are affected. Apps bundling their own TLS (Chromium
and Electron, Go, current bundled OpenSSL) are unreachable — but they also ship modern TLS
already, so they are not broken. The real gap is software linking the system's OpenSSL
0.9.8, notably Python 2.7's `ssl` module: broken *and* unreachable by this design.

Coverage is decided at launch and holds from the process's first instruction: there is no
interval in which a process is running but not yet covered. What a patch does not reach is
processes that were already running when it was applied — they keep the Security they mapped,
and a reboot is what clears them.
