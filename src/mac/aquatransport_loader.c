// The stub that Security.framework's load command actually names.
//
// Splitting the library in two is not organisational tidiness, it is the whole point: a load
// command is unconditional, so whatever Security names is mapped into every process on the
// system whether that process wants it or not. Some processes cannot tolerate that. A DRM
// module, for instance, inspects its own address space and refuses to run when it finds an
// unexpected 9 MB image there -- and it refuses by wedging, not by saying so. No flag the
// engine reads can help, because by the time engine code runs the mapping already happened.
//
// So the unconditional thing is this file, which is small and does nothing, and the engine
// becomes a dlopen() this file performs only for processes that want it. An excluded process
// maps a few pages of stub and nothing else.
//
// Keep this file tiny and dependency-free. It must not link OpenSSL, and it must not import
// anything newer than the deployment target -- build-macos.sh verifies both.
