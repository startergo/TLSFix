// Shared configuration for both AquaTransport subsystems on macOS.
//
// Files live in /usr/share/aquatransport/config (override with AQUATRANSPORT_DIR for development).
// Sandboxed targets read these files themselves, and system.sb confines them to a short list
// of readable directories that /usr/share is on -- see the note in aquatransport_config.c.
//
// flags.txt holds one flag name per line. Recognised flags:
//   debug                        log handshakes to /tmp/aquatransport-<uid>.log
//   disabled-mtls                hand client-certificate connections back to the system stack
//   disable-certificate-pinning  honour system and keychain anchors for anchor-restricted
//                                evaluations, defeating pinning process-wide (for monitoring
//                                your own traffic through a locally trusted proxy root)
//
// disabled.txt holds one executable name per line, matched exactly against
// getprogname(). A listed process gets nothing installed in it -- no hooks, no gate -- so it
// keeps the system TLS stack and every other process is unaffected. Intended for processes
// hosting third-party code that inspects its own address space and will not tolerate having
// its imports rebound. Find the name to list in Activity Monitor or `ps -axco command`; for an
// XPC service it is the service's bundle identifier, e.g. com.apple.WebKit.WebContent.
