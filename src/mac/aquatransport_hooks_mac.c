// macOS hook layer for AquaTransport (10.6 - 10.9).
//
// Hooks are installed with fishhook, which rebinds symbol pointers by name. Properties this
// relies on:
//
//   1. Rebinding rewrites call sites instead of patching function bodies, so the
//      "function too small, clobbers adjacent memory" problem does not arise and
//      SSLClose/SSLDisposeContext are safe to hook.
//   2. Rebinding does not require the library to be present at process launch. This library
//      arrives with Security.framework, which names it in a load command, and plenty of
//      processes reach Security through a dlopen long after CFNetwork has bound and used its
//      Secure Transport imports. Measured on 10.6.8 and 10.9.5, i386 and x86_64: an image
//      loaded at that point still rebinds CFNetwork's calls into Secure Transport, after
//      those symbols have already been bound and used.
//   3. install_ssl_hooks() decides per process whether to install anything, so a process on
//      the trust-daemon deny list carries no hooks at all. The per-hook tf_on() gate still
//      runs on every call, because tf_reentrant() is dynamic and cannot be decided at install
//      time.
//
// CALLING THE ORIGINAL -- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING
//
// Never call a hooked function by name from this file. fishhook rebinds the symbol in
// EVERY loaded image, including this one, so `SSLHandshake(c)` here would land back in
// my_SSLHandshake and recurse until the process dies. Always call through o_SSLHandshake.
// For the same reason, never use dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, ...) to reach an original: it resolves
// back to the replacement.
//
// The o_* pointers come from dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT), not from fishhook's `replaced` output.
// That is deliberate. fishhook reports whatever value was sitting in the symbol slot, and
// for a lazy symbol that has not been called yet that value is dyld's stub binder helper,
// not the function. dlsym resolves through the symbol table and always yields the real
// implementation, whether or not the symbol has ever been bound.
